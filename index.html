            <h2>Where I am from</h2>
            <p>I was born in San Jose, California and have been here
                all my life, I have been to only 3 schools. The schools
                that i have been to are Katherine smith elemenatry, 
                alpha blanca, and now alpha cindy avitia. I have only
                gone once out of the states and that was to Mexico 
                where I spent 1 month(i was 4). I have not left san jose
                that much all I know is san jose and that is all my world 
                is pretty small.
            </p>
            <h2>What I am working on right now</h2>
            <p>I am a student at Alpha cindy avitia highschool and I 
              am taking computer sience classes and many other exiting
              classes at Alpha cindy. In my free time I like to do nothing
              because I don't have a hobby so i just sit around and do
              nothing I occasionaly play soccer out side.
